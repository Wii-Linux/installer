   ========   General Information About the Wii Linux Installer   ==========   

The Wii Linux Installer has some very interesting design goals behind it that I
would like to share here.  It (attempts to) solve a very tricky problem.
Obviously, it's main goal is to, from your Wii, bootstrap an entire Wii Linux
Void-PPC system, complete with Gumboot and it's associated fork of MINI.
However, it's actually not just _that_ easy.  See, most users will only have a
single FAT32 partition present on their SD Card.  Linux requires a partition
that is _not_ FAT32 in order to work correctly.  So, how does the user set that
up?  It's easy to just make them do it themselves, but that's not very
user-friendly.


   ========                The Partitioning Problem               ==========   

See, I want the installer to be able to partition the user's boot media. On
the surface level that sounds fine.  Tons of other installers for PC and the
like can do that just fine, and have been for ages, why would this be any
different?  Well, the Wii is strange, in the sense that the install media,
(on a PC this would be the bootable USB stick, or DVD-ROM), is the same as the
boot media (on a PC, this would be your Hard Disk or SSD).  This presents a
very interesting problem.  How do you partition the media in which you are
actively booted from?  My solution to the problem is quite simple, however
incredibly difficult to pull off.  It simply _isn't_ actively booted from it.


   ========                      The Solution                     ==========   

The Wii Linux Installer aims to solve the partitioning problem by, as
mentioned, simply not actively running via the boot media.  It loads via the
boot media, but then pivots to running entirely out of RAM.  This now enters
"Stage 1", of the Wii Linux Installer.
