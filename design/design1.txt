Wii Linux        By: Techflash             Aug. 2, 2024      Installer - Stage 1

   ========         General Overview of What Stage 1 Does         ==========   

Stage 1 of the Wii Linux installer is responsible for performing disk
partitioning, and bringing up the network.  Since it is loaded via RAM to
facilitate disk partitioning, this is a huge issue.


   ========                The Problem with Stage 1                ==========   

The biggest issue is that networking and USB are massive pieces that take a
lot of storage space, at least when talking in the scale of the Wii's RAM
(88MB total, 64MB usable), those tiny pieces suddenly are massive and hard to
fit into the cramped space.


   ========                      The Solution                     ==========   

The goal is to be able to have stage1 load entirely from compressed RAM (ZRAM),
then it does disk partitioning, and now, since it has a writable filesystem to
use, it writes itself to disk, purges itsefl from RAM, and jumps over to the
copy on disk.  The copy on disk recognizes the progress that has been made so
far, and continues where it left off, by attempting to configure networking,
having the user provide info if necessary.  It then uses this networking and
free RAM to download "Stage 2" from the internet, and launch it.
